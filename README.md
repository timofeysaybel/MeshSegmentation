# Mesh Segmentation

## Basic definition of mesh segmentation problem:

Let M be a 3D boundary-mesh, and S the set of mesh elements which is either V ,E or F . A segmentation Σ of M is the set of sub-meshes Σ ={M0,...,Mk−1} induced by a partition of S into k disjoint sub-sets

### Algorithm

      1) Assigning distances to all pairs of faces in the mesh.
      2) After computing an initial decomposition, assigning each face a probability of belonging to each patch.
      3) Computing a fuzzy decomposition by refining the probability values using an iterative clustering scheme.
      4) Constructing the exact boundaries between the components, thus transforming the fuzzy decomposition into the final one.

**Computational complexity:** O(F^2*logF), F - faces.

### Algorithm

    Initialize a priority queue Q of elements
    Loop until all elements are clustered
    Choose a seed element and insert to Q
    Create a cluster C from seed
    Loop until Q is empty
        Get the next element s from Q
        If s can be clustered into C
            Cluster s into C
            Insert s neighbors to Q
    Merge small clusters into neighboring ones

**Computational complexity:** O(F^2), F - faces.
