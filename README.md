# MeshSegmentation

## Basic definition of mesh segmentation problem:

Let M be a 3D boundary-mesh, and S the set of mesh elements which is either V ,E or F . A segmentation Σ of M is the set of sub-meshes Σ ={M0,...,Mk−1} induced by a partition of S into k disjoint sub-sets

## Algoritms:
  1) Graph-Cut techniques

  2) Region Growing

  3) Hierarchical clustering

  4) Iterative clustering

  5) Spectral analysis
